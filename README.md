# 🎮 Treasure Island – A Text-Based Adventure Game 🏝️  

**Treasure Island** is an interactive **Python-based adventure game** where players make choices to navigate through a mysterious island in search of hidden treasure! 💰  

## 🔥 Features  
✔️ **Multiple Choice-Based Gameplay** – Each decision affects the outcome!  
✔️ **Sound Effects 🎵** – Added immersive audio using `pygame` for background music & event sounds.  
✔️ **Colorful CLI 🎨** – Enhanced the experience with **ANSI escape codes** for vibrant text formatting.  
✔️ **Simple Yet Engaging Storytelling 📖** – A fun way to practice Python's **conditional statements** & logic.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python 🐍  
- `pygame` (for sound effects 🎶)  
- ANSI Escape Codes (for colored text 🎨)  

## 🚀 How to Play  

1️⃣ Install Python
- Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from Python's official website.
2️⃣ Install pygame
- This game requires the pygame module for handling sound effects. Install it using the following command: ***pip install pygame***
3️⃣ Add Required Audio Files 🎵
- Place the following MP3 audio files in the same folder as your Python script:
1. background.mp3 (Background music)
2. win.mp3 (Winning sound)
3. gameover.mp3 (Game over sound)
- These files are essential for the game’s sound effects to work properly.

## 💡 Inspiration  
This project was built as part of my **#100DaysOfCode** challenge while learning **Conditional Statements, Logical Operators, and Scope** in Python.  

## 🏆 What's Next?  
- Add a **GUI version** using Tkinter or Pygame  
- More story branches for richer gameplay  
- Inventory & points system
